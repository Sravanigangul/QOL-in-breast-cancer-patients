This project is about 
assessing the health-related quality of life by using 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 and 
the adverse effects of chemotherapy in breast 
cancer patients. In tertiary care hospitals, we 
gathered information from 70 patients. Although 
breast cancer is typically thought of as a disease 
that primarily affects women, our study shows that 
it can also impact men. Premenopausal women in 
this age range of 40â€“49 years account for the 
highest percentage of those with breast cancer in 
the study population (30%).  A total of 21 ADRs 
were recorded from 70 patients. The most common 
ADRs were nausea, alopecia, weight loss, and 
insomnia. Naranjo's causality assessment showed 
71.1% possible (score 4) and 28.9% probable 
(score 5-6). A total of 30.9% of ADRs are 
preventable nausea, vomiting, and constipation. 
Compared to elder age groups, women in the 30-39 
age bracket do the least well on a functional scale.
